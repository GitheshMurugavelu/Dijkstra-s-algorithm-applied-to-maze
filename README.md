# Dijkstra-s-algorithm-applied-to-maze
This is the Dijkstra's algorithm applied to a specific maze.

The starting variables are a series of nodes and the distance from it to every other node. This is done manually and accounts for walls.
The Dijkstra method takes in the starting node and end.
The output is a list of nodes ordered in the fastest route between the two nodes.
